Cell Lysis:
Frozen cell pellet resuspended in 20 ml binging buffer.
Sonicated for 6 minutes on time, 2 seconds on at 70% intensity, 2 seconds off. 
Take 20 uL sample after sonication.
Spin down at (### g). Take samples of supernatant and pellet.

Protein Purification:
NI-NTA-IMAC columns (### details) equilibrated with binding buffer. Load the supernatant. Wash with binding buffer (### times). 
Elute with elution buffer and collect fractions.
#mL of protein sample was loaded to (SEC ## mL, 15 mL loop) to further purify the protein. 




# B3 had a good expression, lot of protein purified after his tag, but aggregated once in PBS buffer. significant pellet after first spin down. Then after a day in a fridge, one more spin down with significnat pellet (two thirds aggregated)




# Further experiments (Necessary):

- 'C6' expression test. (transformation was done later in the visit)
- set up crystal trays for three already-purified deltaproteins (A11, B10, F4). 

- characterise remaining 11 deltaproteins that expressed. Would start with high/medium expressing (5/11 proteins).

    "Well Position"	"expression_levels"
    A3	low
    A5	high
    A6	low
    A7	medium
    A8	low
    A10	medium
    B1	low
    B2	high
    B4	low
    C1	medium
    C3	low

- design a small molecule binder (heme?) and experimentally validate it



# Further experiments (Optional):

- Completely prove that it is not oligomerising: 
    run cd melt at 10x lower conc, but use 1 cm cuvette with stirrer. 
    Expect to see same graph like with higher conc, no concentration dependence. 

- Check for burried tryptophans









# SAXS samples:
Sending my SAXS sample protein sequences. Sent 6 different proteins named A1, A9, A12, B8, B12, F4. 
These proteins are in B21-00544 rack (1-8 positions) and in B21-00503 rack (5-6 positions). There is a duplicate sample for each protein (with different concentration)
