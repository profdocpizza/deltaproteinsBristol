Cell Lysis:
Frozen cell pellet resuspended in 20 ml binging buffer.
Sonicated for 6 minutes on time, 2 seconds on at 70% intensity, 2 seconds off. 
Take 20 uL sample after sonication.
Spin down at (### g). Take samples of supernatant and pellet.

Protein Purification:
NI-NTA-IMAC columns (### details) equilibrated with binding buffer. Load the supernatant. Wash with binding buffer (### times). 
Elute with elution buffer and collect fractions.
#mL of protein sample was loaded to (SEC ## mL, 15 mL loop) to further purify the protein. 










# Further experiments (Dek's suggestion):
Completely prove that it is not oligomerising: run cd melt at 10x lower conc, but use 1 cm cuvette with stirrer. 
Expect to see same graph like with higher conc, no concentration dependence.
